# Material for Open OnDemand and MyLRC web portals traing held on 2 February 2023

Open OnDemand (OOD) is browser-based High Performance Computing (HPC) portal supported by NSF. OOD is the easiest way to access HPC resources in addition to the command line approach. The Scientific High Performance Computing group offers the Open OnDemand service for accessing Lawrencium and other dedicated research clusters in our HPC infrastructure.

MyLRC is a web platform designed for automated management of Lawrencium cluster accounts, including user accounts, PCA, condo and recharge projects, billing reports, and project ID validation.

This workshop is a handson cpurse on OOD on Lawrencium supercluster and MyLRC User portal for account requests and management. This training will cover the following topics.

**Part I : Using MyLRC portal**
- Getting a user account on LRC
- Getting access to project
- Requesting project account and management

**Part II : OOD Applications**
- Command-line shell access
- File management
